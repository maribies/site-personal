          <p> This website is meant to be a reflection of me. It is the place for me to express myself and show off my passions.
I’ve always been a bit different. Born in the country, I moved to the city, and eventually kept moving around the world.  I’ve discovered so much more to myself and life, which I’d like to share. I’m finally making a life in which I do what I love and love what I do.
It’s also a place for me to connect- in whatever way that may be- travel, design, or even grilled cheese!
Keep scrolling to discover more. </p>
